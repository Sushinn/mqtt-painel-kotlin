# MQTT Painel (in Kotlin)

This is a simple android application to subscribe and publish to MQTT topics.

I'm developing this to go along with my undergraduate thesis, so it uses the concept of `Sensors` and `Equipments`, but at the end both are just topics.

This app uses `Eclipse Paho MQTT client` library, and it was written in kotlin!

This project uses a very old stack, so it may need some refactoring to run on a modern Android Studio!
